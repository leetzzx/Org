  1. open file
  2. print file
  3. write file
  4. keybinding
  5. command line
  6. quick move
* modules
** file class
*** open file
*** print file
    - print file should be planned as we think
    - print empty line
    - print cursor
    - print linenumber
    - whether the line is wraped
    - what does the cursor look like
*** edit file
*** write file
*** recent file
*** rc config file
*** recongnize file type and perform differently
** operator class
   - map different functions to operators
** keybinding class
   - binding operators to keys 
*** recorgnize keys
*** binding to specific operators
    - this rely on operator class
*** rebinding
*** multi-binding
** window class    
*** open command line
*** split windows
** buffer class
*** record the file opened
*** switch between buffers
** Privilege manage
** libs
   - readline
   - libedit
   - termcap
** 一些流程 interrogating
   1. 选一个图形界面
   2. 为文本设计一个数据结构
   3. 文本排版
   4. 语言模型 word2vec
      - 还有与文本相关的排序一类的东西
   5. 内嵌模块
   6. 内嵌脚本语言
   7. 国际化支持
