* How to Art
  - That means wos should describe a specific solution with reduced
    procedure that mey be boring or small to deal with different kinds
    of problem belonging to the same category even there seem to be
    big span between them.
  - just like "add". it means put two same "thing" together, what we
    should do is finding how to describe "same" and "two". Then how to
    describe "put together".
  - our program should not be complex, I mean, it should contain
    different modules, and gether them together. We should also offer
    interface for it, because we should support user with frindly
    interation, which is substantial(curcial).
  - (+ a b)
  - on different level of add, it may contain complex manipulates, but
    at their level, the logic is same.
  - offering interface reduce the complexibity of program. The
    interface is always conventional. So we can use it to realize the
    functions of upper level
  - Sometimes offering interface means initialize some paramater of
    the program.
* ways to control flexibility
  1. making new languages
* components of language
  1. Primitive Elements
  2. Means of combination
  3. Means of abstraction
* substitution(代换) rules
  1. evaluate the operator to get procedure
  2. evaluate the operands to get auguments
  3. apply the procedure to the auguments
     - copy the body of procedure, substituting the auguments supplied
       for the formal paramaters of the procedure.
     - Evaluate the resulting new body ;; just like substitute the
       former application with a new body which is defined as body,
       and the paramaters is substituted, too. 
  4. The key to understanding complacted thing is know what not to look
  at and what not compute and what not to think
* other order evaluation called normal order evaluation
  - substitute the operands with expressions
  - the order doesn't affect the answer
* evaluate if expression
  1. evaluate the predicate(述词 断定) expression
     - if it yields true
       * evaluate the consequent expression
     - otherwise
       * evaluate the alternative expression
  2. <predicate>
  3. <conditions>
  4. <alternative>
* two dimension during the evaluation
  - space
  - time
  - Recursion and interation
* Higher order procedure
  - if we know the result we simply write it down
  - else we simplify it into small procedures
  - I can write down some procedure to structure the problem to solve
    the same kind of problem (common pattern of usage)
  - one of the things you can do in this language that we're showing
    you is not only do you know something like that but you give the
    knowledage of that a name
* procedure arugments（过程参数）
  - write arugments in level with the same identation
  - two ways to get a converging number
    1. take average
    2. damp out (渐次减弱振动幅度)
    3. we can do some pretreatment（预处理） with lambda and send it
       as arugment to another lambda
* The rights and privileges of first-class citizens
  1. to be named by variables
  2. to be passwd as arguments to procedures
  3. to be returned as values of procedures
  4. to be incorporated into data structures
* Building things
  - we divorce task of building things from the task of implementing
    the parts
* compound data（复合数据）data abstraction
  - means of combination data
  - compound object should look like a primitive
  - methodology of abstraction
  - primitive data
  - selectors and constructors
  - We are separating the way objects is used from the
    representation of data objects(constructors and selectors)
  - it means that we have the flexibility to realize a problem, we can
    use the wishful thinking, to do the next stage of program without
    thinking how to realize the way difining the data
  - pairs of pairs is substantial, because it shows that if we can
    construce a thing which is closure（闭包
  - There is some contract we can combinate the abstraction layer and
    the using layer to testify whether the abstraction is suitable
    enough even if we don't know how abstraction is realized
  - The abstraction of structure don't consist of any numbers
* Henderson Escher（亨德森埃舍尔）
  - his work is full of science and phisolophy and always represent a paradox
* meta-linguistic abstraction
  - the idea that one of the ways of tackling complexibity in
    engineering design
  - we're using the procedural representation to ensure this closure 
* dispatch on the type of the expression
  - languages is made out of different expressions
* pattern-maching: rule-based substitution
  - pattern - skeleton - source expression - target expression
  - rule each rule has pattern and skeleton
  - match
  - instantiater
* Generic Operators
  - dispatch on type
  - data-directed programming
    * the data objects themselves are catting with them the
      informanion about how you should operate on them
  - DECENTRALIZED CONTROL
* assignment
  - assignment is the first thing we have that produces the difference
    between a before and an after
  - bound variables
  - there're nothing shared among all of the instances of that name
    + name is that we find something out
  - environment maybe some function, or a table or something like that
    but it is structured of table, it's made out of things called
    frames
  - assignment assure the ability to stain a state which called local
    state without post out the variables in functions, it contained
    the consistnent of program
* computational objects
  - unanticipated interations between objects is the source of most of
    the bugs that occur in complicated programs
  - by introducing this posibility of things having idendity and
    sharing and having multiple names for the same thing, we got lots
    of power. But we're going to pay for it with lots of complexity
    and bugs
* Stream procress
  - stream to be a data structure that sorts of computes itself
    incrementally sort of on-demand data structure
* universal machine
  - eval a program in the program ways
  - we can make this data directed, so there wouldn't be sequence of
    conditions here, there'd be a dispatch on some bits, they would
    run fast
  - this can be used to test feature of new language and about
    language design
